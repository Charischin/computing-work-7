# wet market

I retch at the fishy smell filling up every edge and corner of the market, while watching out for suspicious puddles of what is hopefully just water on the floor. Ugh, why did I agree to come to the wet market with my grandmother? I could have been comfortably lying on the sofa at home, catching up on my favourite show, Kin, but here I was, surrounded by a sea of old aunties budging their way through and the piercing yells of stall owners trying to attract people to their stalls.
